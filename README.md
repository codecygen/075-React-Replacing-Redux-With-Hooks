This app uses Context API to manage favoriting and unfavoriting items that you can see in the list.

Although I exchanged Redux library with Context API, favoriting and unfavoriting things in this app is a high frequency update and it is not recommended by the React team since it is a high frequency update. This was just for an experimental purpose.
